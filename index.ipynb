    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn/turnover is a significant concern for telecommunications companies like SyriaTel. Churn occurs when customers discontinue their service, leading to revenue loss and increased costs for acquiring new customers. Understanding and predicting churn enables companies like SyriaTel to take proactive measures to retain customers at risk of leaving, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing financial losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that identifies SyriaTel customers likely to end their relationship with the company. By accurately predicting the turnover, SyriaTel can focus its retention efforts on at-risk customers, ultimately reducing churn rates and enhancing the company's profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project contains records of 3,333 SyriaTel customers. The dataset includes various attributes related to customer demographics, account details, service usage, and customer service interactions. The target variable is churn, a binary indicator of whether a customer has stopped using SyriaTelâ€™s services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "For SyriaTel, retaining customers is crucial to maintaining a stable revenue stream. By analyzing data on customer behavior and service usage, the company can identify patterns that suggest a higher likelihood of turnover. The predictive model developed in this project will assist SyriaTel in implementing targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers or improved customer support, to reduce churn."
